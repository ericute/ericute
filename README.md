# Hello, World! I'm Eric. ðŸ‘‹

I am a developer. I've always been ***passionate*** in building something that could ***make living life easier*** and ***more enjoyable***.

On my free time, I work on the Shopify platform ðŸ›’ with React as the front-end (lib/framework), and Next.js / Koa.js as the back-end frameworks.

### *What have I been doing in the corporate world?*

I started my development career in 2008. I was doing ***Java*** development handling utilities. A couple of years after, I switched my line of work into insurance applications still using Java while consuming Pega REST APIs. After my insurance stint, I got into request automation. The front-end is basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript and backend is scripting active directory CRUD operations, server provisioning (spinning up, managing resources. etc.), and API consumption getting/posting data into different streams. This is where my interest in JavaScript peaked. I learned Node.js and Express. I learned AngularJS and Angular. I'm currently employed at a law firm managing development and maintenance of their intranet with SharePoint as the platform wrapping it with AngularJS. I also build apps for other teams for process improvement.
