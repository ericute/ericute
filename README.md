# Hello, World! I'm Eric. ðŸ‘‹

I am a developer. I've always been **_passionate_** in building something that could **_make living life easier_** and **_more enjoyable_**.

I work on the Shopify platform ðŸ›’ with React as the front-end (lib/framework), and Next.js / Koa.js as the back-end frameworks.

### _What have I been doing in the corporate world?_

I started my development career in 2008. I was doing **_Java_** development handling utilities. A couple of years after, I switched my line of work into insurance applications still using Java while consuming Pega REST APIs. After my insurance stint, I got into automation. Simple front-end (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) with variety of backend scripts to grant requests - Active Directory CRUD operations, server provisioning (spinning up, managing resources. etc.), and API consumption getting/posting data into different app endpoints. This is where my interest in **_JavaScript_** peaked. I studied node for the backend and **_Angular_** for the frontend. A few years later, I ventured into a different line of business by joining a law firm. I was driving the Manila development team in handling the global intranet with **_SharePoint_** as the platform wrapped with **AngularJS**. Apart from this, I built apps for other teams (and helped them build/maintain their own apps) for process improvements using **_Angular_**, **_React_** and **_Node.js_**. Nowadays, I'm back as a principal consultant in a tech company specializing in billing & revenue management. I'm leading the data migration team.

### _Fun facts about me_

When I'm not in front of a computer, you can find me everywhere. I love doing long drives/road trips ðŸš˜. I've been hiking since 2012 . I started long bike rides in 2019. During pandemic, I did remote work for a couple of months in an island and have made friends there. With all that, you may find it weird that I consider myself an introvert. I'm actually very awkward at small talks ðŸ˜… but I like deep and meaningful conversations.ðŸ¤©
