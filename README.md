# Hello, world! I'm Eric. 👋

I am a developer. I've always been ***passionate*** in building something that could ***make living life easier*** and ***more enjoyable***.


### *Career Journey & Highlights...*

- I started my development career in ***Oracle Philippines Corp.*** back in 2008. 👓 I was doing ***Java*** development for a tool called CC&B (Customer Care & Billing). I also experienced working on their Product development team handling the code for language translations.
- It was around 2010 when I switched jobs. I was outsourced to ***AIG*** (which was eventually acquired by Accenture). I joined a bootcamp for Pegasystems. The tool that was being offered was PegaRules Process Commander (PRPC). It is a [CRM](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/customer_relation_management.asp) tool. I even got certified for it in 2010. I was using still using and consuming PRPC REST APIs for business rules.
- While I was working on a fleet of insurance apps back in 2012, I needed to do a lot of client-side computations. That's how I saw the potential of ***JavaScript***. In 2013, I left AIG and joined ***Macquarie***. I shifted my career to JavaScript development. Best. Decision. Ever.
- From 2013 to 2018, I was doing automation for Macquarie. This mostly involved scripting active directory calls, windows scripting, server provisioning, etc. I was part of the team that converted manual repititive tasks from other teams. This is where I developed my passion of optimizing day-to-day tasks. ***The common denominator of all this, the UI is simply driven by JavaScript***.
- Between 2017-2018, I discovered AngularJS, then Angular. I learned and taught Angular to my team. This improved the UI of the services we offered then. 
- In 2018, I joined the banking department of Macquarie. I got heavily involved in migrating applications to the cloud via AWS. My team's JasperReport DB was the first one that was completely migrated to Cloud RDS in Production. A lot of other apps followed suit.
- In 2019, I moved to another company: ***White & Case Global Operations Center - Manila (LLP)***. I'm part of the team that handles the firm's intranet. I was lucky to represent my department in the Continuous Improvement competition. 🍀 I built an app that processed lawyer onboarding files. This sped up ⏫ the processing time from hours/days to just a few minutes. This was a milestone for me.
- In 2020, I requested to be involved in the redundancy activities for the intranet. Prior to me joining this, it had been going on for over a year. It took just a little over 3mos. after I joined when we completed this project. Later in the year, I got involved in a massing HR project.
- By 2021, I was the only developer working on 6 different project streams for the HR Project. This involved hundreds of sites with hundreds of pages within SharePoint (Yes, that is unfortunately true) 😅. I built reusable AngularJS components instead of using SharePoint webparts 👍. This design allowed very easy reusabilty. I was very happy with the outcome 😃. I even got nominated and eventually won for the massive work that me and my team did. 🙇‍♂️

💡 😎 ⤴️ I know, I am quite busy in my corporate work; but, my passion doesn't end there. On my free time, I work on the Shopify platform with React as the front-end (lib/framework), and Next.js / Koa.js as the back-end frameworks.
