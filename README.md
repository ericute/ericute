# Hello, World! I'm Eric. 👋

I am a developer. I've always been ***passionate*** in building something that could ***make living life easier*** and ***more enjoyable***.

On my free time, I work on the Shopify platform 🛒 with React as the front-end (lib/framework), and Next.js / Koa.js as the back-end frameworks.

### *What have I been doing in the corporate world?*

I started my development career in 2008. I was doing ***Java*** development handling utilities. A couple of years after, I switched my line of work into insurance applications still using Java while consuming Pega REST APIs. After my insurance stint, I got into automation. Simple front-end (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) with variety of backend script to grant what is needed - active directory CRUD operations, server provisioning (spinning up, managing resources. etc.), and API consumption getting/posting data into different app endpoints. This is where my interest in JavaScript peaked. I then learned Angular. I'm currently employed at a law firm managing development and maintenance of their intranet with SharePoint as the platform wrapping it with AngularJS. I also build apps for other teams (and help them build/maintain their own apps) for process improvement.
